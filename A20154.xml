            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>Paul</hi> in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Chapter doth compare the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Baptiſme to the red Sea: So doth <hi>Chryſostome</hi> compare the Sacrament of the Lords Supper;<note place="margin">Chryſ. in Pſa. <hi>113.</hi>
                     </note> and that very fitly. For as the red Sea was <hi>alijs ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulchrum,
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:10095:10"/> alijs vehiculum,</hi> to the one a ſepulcher to ſwallow them, to the other a Chariot to carry them ſafely from the face and fury of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: ſo the bleſſed Sacrament is the bread of life, and as a ſanctuary of comfort to a ſanctified heart, but to the wicked and profane, it is the bane of their ſoules, and a gulfe of eternall perdition.</p>
                  <p>Now what more lamentable, then that Gods holy ordinance, prouided for the bliſſe, ſhould turne to the bane of his people? Yet what more ordinary? And thus the Apoſtle findes that the Sacrament was to the Corinthians, who by their vnwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy receiuing depriued themſelues of ſpirituall comfort, &amp; drew down vpon them temporall iudgements; The abuſes of which people he la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors to reforme, and to that end ſets downe the diuine frame of that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenly ſtructure, drawne by the hand of Chriſt himſelfe: and that neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily: For as he that will either direct his own worke, or correct anothers
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:10095:10"/> exactly, muſt propound vnto him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe a perfect patterne: ſo the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Apoſtle doth take a perfect pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terne, and platforme of our Sauiour Chriſt, as <hi>Moſes</hi> did his patterne of the Arke and Tabernacle from al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God.<note place="margin">Exod. 25.9.</note> He comes like <hi>Pytha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goras</hi> ſcholler with his <hi>ipſi dixit.</hi> His Office is for ſearching for propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and abuſers of the bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: therefore he comes with the ayde of authority, and brings his warrant with him; ſaying, <hi>I haue receiued from the Lord, that which I haue deliuered vnto you.</hi> It fares with men in their errors, as with thoſe that are ſicke, or aſleepe; the one cannot abide to be touched, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to be awaked.</p>
                  <p>Reproofe hardly findes accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, except it be backed with au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and he that will reforme a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſes, muſt build vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> a ſure ground; What better warrant then from the Lord? What ſounder direction then the example of Ieſus Chriſt? What greater authority then from the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:10095:11"/> King of Kings? Now with theſe the Apoſtle is furniſhed, and for the ground of reformation hee layes downe our Sauiours Inſtitution: In proſecuting whereof, hee ſhewes himſelfe to haue beene brought vp at the feet of <hi>Gamaliel,</hi> and a worthy proficient in the Schoole of Chriſt, ſo exactly and diuinely doth he han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle this ſacred myſtery.</p>

                     <pb n="14" facs="tcp:10095:16"/>
                     <p>Againe, this circumſtance of time may ſerue to reſolue two waightie queſtions.</p>
                     <p>The firſt, whether we doe well in adminiſtring the Sacrament in the morming: ſeeing that herein we va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry from our Sauiours practice? For as the Church of God, wher there is no precept to enioyne, is not ſtrictly bound to euery circumſtantiall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Chriſt, or his Apoſtles, as anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity hath euer well determined: ſo this circumſtance of time, in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diuiduail act of our Sauiours, (being grounded vpon ſuch reaſons as to him were vrgent and neceſſary, but are not ſo to vs,) doth not binde vs to imitation. Chriſt was furniſhed with a ſmall number, and tyed to a priuate Chamber, to preuent vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, &amp; diſturbance; We haue the benefit of the publique Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; our gracious God (bleſſed be his name) hauing planted peace in our Tabernacles, and ſet open the dores of his Temple vnto vs, ſo that euery one may haue acceſſe to his
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:10095:16"/> houſe, and take of the water of life freely. We haue neither the occaſion of Chriſts approching departure to require it, nor his leauing it as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent pledge of his loue to challe<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ge it, nor the concurring of his paſſion to cal for it, nor the neceſſity of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent Paſſeouer to vrge it, that we ſhould celebrate it in the euening.</p>
                     <p>So that this circumſtance of time being temporary, is alſo arbitrary, the Spouſe of Chriſt hauing power to order this ſo,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 14.40.</note> as may beſt tend to comlineſſe and order. And here by the way we may obſerue that poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Andradius</hi> to be full of abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dity, and preſumption: namely,<note place="margin">Andrad. Or<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thod. expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat. lib. <hi>7.</hi>
                        </note> that the Church may as well take away the Cup from the Sacrament, as al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the time of adminiſtration. For beſides that the one is a matter of ſubſtance, the other onely of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, there is not the like ground, cauſe, neceſſity for the one as for the other.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it may be queſtioned whether it be lawfull to eat or drink
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:10095:17"/> before the receiuing of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and this circumſtance ſerues to reſolue that doubt. For if it were ſimply vnlawfull, then would not our Sauiour or his ſeruants who ſucceeded him in gouerning the Church, haue celebrated the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment after ſupper; which that they did, both this place and the ſtory of the Euangeliſts, together with the practice of the primitiue Church, doe euidently, and aboundantly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate.</p>
                     <p>This queſtion hath beene racked on the tenters of curioſity by the Romaniſts, who held it piacular to eat or drink before the receiuing of the Sacrament:<note place="margin">Aquinas in Mat. <hi>16.</hi>
                        </note> inſomuch that ſome haue fallen into theſe ſuperſtitious niceties, to queſtion whether a man waſhing his face in the morning, ſo that a little water goe downe his throat, or whether hauing eaten An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſe ſeedes ouer night, and ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining between his teeth he ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low it in the morning, whether I ſay, he haue broken his faſt; &amp; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:10095:17"/> diſabled himſelfe for recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Sacrament.</p>
                     <p>But the truth is, that as it is not ſimply vnlawfull to eate or drinke before the receiuing of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: ſo it is very expedient, (ſo it be without manifeſt indangering of health) to receiue it faſting. My rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are theſe:</p>
                     <p>Firſt, the Sacrament being the bread of life, and our ſpirituall food, it is moſt reaſonable and regular, that we feede our ſoules before our bodies; that ſo we may obſerue our Sauiours rule,<note place="margin">Mat. 6.33.</note> in <hi>ſeeking firſt the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of God,</hi> both in time and eſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Secondly,<note place="margin">Qui ieinnat, leuior eſt &amp; vigilanter o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. Chryſ. in Mat. ho. <hi>58.</hi>
                        </note> when we come fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting, we are more fit for meditation and prayer, two eſpeciall duties re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired in the worthy receiuing of the Sacrament. For as in vrgent and extraordinary occaſions, the Church is wont to ioyn faſting with prayer, that the ſame, being an Act of humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation, may ſtirre vp deuotion in our owne hearts, and procure compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:10095:18"/> at Gods hands: So is it likewiſe needfull, in this worthy &amp; waighty duty, that our prayers may pierce the heauens, and aſcend before the Throne of Grace, &amp; that our medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations being therwith winged, may more nimbly mount vp to Ieſus Chriſt the ſubiect of the bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, euen in reuerence to this ſacred ordinance, it ſhall be good to abſtaine from meate. For as the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle requires a diſcerning of the Lords body: ſo I hold it fit with S. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Aug. ep. <hi>118.</hi>
                        </note> that by comming faſting to this bleſſed banquet, we put a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene this and all other meats. Neither is the Churches pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice to be contemned, which hath vſually obſerued this cuſtome tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowout the Chriſtian world.</p>
                     <p>Again, this circumſtance of Time, with the reaſons before mentioned, may ſerue to ſet forth the waight and worth of the Sacrament. If we ſhould ſee ſome vnderſtanding man that is ready to dye, totally employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:10095:18"/> about ſome one eſpeciall buſines, we would readily coniecture, that the ſame muſt needs be a matter of great moment. And doth not our Sauiours ſerious employment about the bleſſed Sacrament, a little before his Paſſion, plainely argue the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency thereof? If a faithfull huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band departing from his beloued ſpouſe, ſhall leaue a ring, or ſome o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch remembrance of his loue, how much will ſhe eſteeme it? how carefully will ſhe keepe it? how af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately will ſhe behold it? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, Chriſt Ieſus departing from his deareſt Spouſe the Church, hath left vnto her the bleſſed Sacrament, as a rich pledge of his vnſpeakeable loue; Oh how highly then ſhould wee eſteeme it? how comfortable ſhould the vſe and participation thereof be vnto vs?</p>
                     <p>Laſtly, in this circumſtance of Time from our Sauiors practice, we muſt frame to our ſelues a rule of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; that is, to grace our actions with the choice of opportunity. For
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:10095:19"/> opportunity indeed is the grace and glory of our Actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s: ſo that a word ſpoken in due ſeaſon, is like apples of <hi>gold with pictures of ſiluer.</hi>

                     <p>Chriſt had now but a little time, and he would not loſe it; he had a fit opportunity to inſtitute the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, and he did not neglect it.

                     <p>Firſt, the Sacraments are an eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall part of Gods worſhip; they are military badges, whereby we pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely profeſſe our ſelues to be the ſouldiers &amp; ſeruants of Ieſus Chriſt, whilſt we ſerue in his Campe, and vnder his colours: Acknowledging that no other ſhall preſcribe to vs any Sacraments but onely Chriſt, by whom alone we looke for eternall ſaluation. Therefore St. <hi>Paul</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimes that honour, which ſome of the Corinthians, forth of their facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous affections, were wont to caſt v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon their ſequeſtred Teachers, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,<note place="margin">1.

                     <p n="2">2. To him it belongs to inſtitute the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ts, who is the author of Grace, and can thereby make them effectuall to the receiuer. And that is onely Chriſt, GOD and man, and not any other who is meerely man.
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:10095:22"/> The Sacraments indeed are like to a ſeale, &amp; as a ſeale giues force to the writing, ſo the Sacraments doe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme to vs the Couenant of grace, but yet they doe this onely as they are ingrauen with the death, and printed with the hand of Chriſt.</p>

                     <p n="4">4. It was neceſſary that Chriſt himſelfe ſhould immediatly inſtitute the Sacraments to preuent ſchiſme.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>OV haue heard of the viſible matter of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, which leades vs, as it were by the hand to take notice of the inuiſible, which is the body and bloud of <hi>Christ:</hi> and this is full of comfort. For by how
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:10095:48"/> much the body is more excellent then the ſhadow, by ſo much doth this heauenly ſubſtance excell the earthly.</p>
                  <p>When we ſay that the body and bloud of Chriſt is the inuiſible mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the Sacrament, we compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend vnder them, whole Chriſt, both ſoule and body, with all his diuine Graces and Merits: Yea the Diuinity alſo in reſpect of efficacy; yet becauſe the humane nature of Chriſt is as it were the Conduit pipe, by which the Diuinity doth conuey grace to vs, therefore we mention onely the receiuing of that in the Euchariſt. But the truth is, that whole Chriſt, both God and man, is made ours, by the worthy participation of this Sacrament. The elements and author of ſaluation are both receiued at one inſtant, if the heart and hand of the receiuer doe their mutuall offices: as the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter giues the viſible ſigne, ſo the Spirit of God imparts the inuiſible Grace. As <hi>Iohn Baptiſt</hi> ſaid, when
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:10095:48"/> he baptized with water.<note place="margin">Mat. 3.11.</note>

                     <hi>and with fire.</hi> So that Chriſt is in the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both <hi>Conuiua</hi> and <hi>conuiuium;</hi> by him we are inuited, and by him we are nouriſhed.</p>
                  <p>This is plaine from the ſacramen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall relation betweene the ſignes and the thing ſignified. For Chriſt Ieſus is not like <hi>Zeuxes,</hi> who fed the birds with painted berries. To offer bare ſignes without the ſubſtance, were a greater deluſion, then can agree with him who is the God of truth. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore are the Bread and Wine in lli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble pledges of the preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>It is ſaid of the children of Iſrael, that they did eate of the ſame ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall meat,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.3, 4.</note>

                  <p>But I would know of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> how a ſeale is a thing better known then the Charter, or what power it hath without ſome writing? If the Ieſuit ſhould haue had the Popes ſcale or bull to a blanke, he would haue found ſmall power or vertue in it to him for a Cardinalſhippe; whereas a writing without a ſeale, may be knowne to be a mans deed, expreſſe his mind, and carry with it in ſome caſes, power to conuey a gift or legacy.</p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="tcp:10095:50"/>
                  <p>Who doubts but that the bare Word of God is of ſufficient autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and yeelds great aſſurance? Yet (as the Apoſtle ſaith) <hi>God being wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling more abundantly to ſhew vnto the heires of promiſe,</hi>

Yet as the Rain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow was giuen for a full aſſurance of the worlds preſeruation from a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall Deluge (which ſhould haue been ratified if there had neuer been Rainebow:) So the Sacraments are giuen as ſeales of the Couenant of Grace and ſaluation, which God hath made to his ſeruants, that ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing both his hand and ſeale, their faith might more fully be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. Therefore for <hi>Bellarmlne</hi> to ſcoffe at the title of a ſeale, and applyed to the Sacrament, is great impiety, and to quarell the Compariſon, is groſſe impudency.</p>
                  <pb n="84" facs="tcp:10095:51"/>
                  <p>The truth of the preſence of Chriſt in the Sacrament will more fully appeare, if we conſider the liuely analogy betweene the ſoul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> &amp; the body. For as the body hath through the ſoule a naturall life, ſo hath the ſoule through grace a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall. As the body is ſubiect to hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.6.</note> ſo is the ſoule. As the body doth languiſh and pine away with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out corporall food, ſo doth the ſoule without ſpirituall nouriſhment: &amp; therfore the one as well as the other muſt be preſerued by meanes. Now the ſame that corporall food is to the body, Chriſt Ieſus is to the ſoule of the beleeuers, according to that in the ſixt of <hi>Iohn,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 6.51.</note> 
                     <hi>I am the liuing bread which came downe from heauen, if any man eate of this bread, he ſhall liue for euer.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verſe 53.</note> And on the contrary, <hi>Except we eate the fleſh of Chriſt, and drinke his bloud, we can haue no life in vs.</hi> As certainely therfore as our bodies are made partakers of the outward ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſo certainely are we aſſured, that being duly prepared, our ſoules
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:10095:51"/> doe feede vpon Ieſus Chriſt. For, <hi>the cup of bleſſing which we bleſſe,</hi>

                     <hi>is it not the Communion of the bloud of Chriſt? and the bread which we breake, is it not the Communion of the Body of Chriſt?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now albeit Chriſt is truly in the Sacrament, yet is hee not locally there, according to the conceit ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Conſubſtantiation or Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſubſtantiation. For the body and bloud of Chriſt are not preſent to the elements, but to the Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicants. There is onely a ſymboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call &amp; rationall vnion betwixt Chriſt and the Elements, but the ſpirituall and reall vnion is betwixt Chriſt &amp; his members. <hi>Andradius</hi> ſaith well; If Chriſt were locally preſent with the elements, as Conſubſtantiators hold, then he ſhould haue ſaid, <hi>In hoc loco eſt corpus meum:</hi>

                  <p>The doctrine of Tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation cannot be maintained, without many impieties and abſurdities.

As the Forme of the Sacrament conſiſts of the acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſo the actions are in number ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, whereof fiue doe belong to the Miniſter, and two to the Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cants, according to the practiſe of our bleſſed Sauiour &amp; his Diſciples, he repreſenting the Paſtor, they the people. Firſt, Chriſt takes the bread: 2. He conſecrates: 3. Hee breakes it: 4. He giues it: 5. He ſhewes the vſe of it. The actions of the people are theſe: 1. They take it: 2. They eat and drinke it. All which actions, like the viſible matter of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, haue reference to Diuine and Spirituall myſteries.</p>
                  <p>The firſt action of our Sauiour is the taking of the bread, that hee might conſecrate it, breake it, and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:10095:67"/> deliuer it to the Diſciples: which ſignifies the taking of our nature, that it being ſanctified, might bee broken with ſorrow for ſatisfaction to God, and giuen to vs in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament for the comfort of our ſoules. So that hereby is repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Incarnation of Chriſt, when the <hi>Word did take fleſh.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 2.14.</note> This action of Chriſt yeelds matter of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration and conſolation. Firſt, here is great cauſe of admiration. For, as <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Bern. in vigil. natal. domini ſerm. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note>

                  <p>And as it yeelds matter of admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, ſo doth it alſo of conſolation.

                  <p>Againe, ſeeing that the elements of bread and wine are ſanctified to a ſacred vſe, we muſt put a difference betweene them &amp; other bread and wine. For the bread after conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

As the gold, which was profane in the furnace, became holy when it was ſanctified to the vſe of the Temple: ſo the bread which was by nature common, by conſecration and vſe is made holy. As the waters of Iordan being ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified by God for the cure of <hi>Naa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2.

                  <p>Againe, ſeeing our Sauiour doth ſanctifie the Sacrament by prayer &amp; thankeſgiuing; this is an action for imitation. Yea, if he gaue thanks to God in our behalfe, how much more ſhould we doe ſo for our ſelues, who
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:10095:71"/> receiue the benefit? and from this duty of thankſgiuing the Sacrament hath that ancient name of Euchariſt.

                  <p>To conclude, ſeeing that the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is ſanctified by prayer and thankeſgiuing, we muſt be carefull to vſe it in a holy and reuerend man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.

                  <p>The third Action is the breaking of the Bread. A man would thinke this a needleſſe ceremony,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.26 Mar. 14.23 Luk. 22.19 1. Cor. 10.16. &amp; 11.24.

Yea, this action giues denomination to the whole celebration of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, which argues that it is a ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remony of great moment, and very worthy of obſeruation. And reaſon, for it is very ſignificant to repreſent the paines of Chriſts Paſſion;<note place="margin">Ioh. 19.36.

                  </p>
                  <p>In which place the Hebrew words are very ſignificant, to ſet forth the extreme paines that Chriſt indured for our ſakes; they imply the whip, the ſpeare, the nayles, the thornes which did pearce the body, and the ſword of ſorrow which did wound the ſoule of our Sauiour. Yea, this breaking of the bread, doth ſet forth the renting of the ſoule and body of Chriſt aſunder.</p>

                  <p>To breake the naturall body of Chriſt actually, were an act of great cruelty,<note place="margin">Ioh. 19.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But concerning this action, the

To ſay it was the body of Chriſt, were to make his body perpetually paſſible; and to ſay it is bread after conſecration, they are loth, becauſe it ouerthrowes their locall preſence. Therfore, theſe ſhelues of abſurdities, vpon which they doe caſt themſelues to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine their errors, ſhould make them ſaile willingly downe the cleere cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nell of truth.</p>
                  <p>Againe, the neceſſary and ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cant vſe of this action, condemnes the practiſe of the Romaniſts, who neglect the ſame, and giue whole cakes to the people.

<pb n="128" facs="tcp:10095:73"/> or doubt that he receiues not whole Chriſt.</hi> But our Sauiour Chriſt and the Primitiue Church, were much ouerſeene, that could not thinke of theſe inconueniences: or elſe the Papiſts are too blame, that cannot teach their people better, or (which is the truth) theſe correcters of the Inſtitution doe play the Impoſtors, who to maintaine an opinion of their carnall preſence, haue abandoned this comfortable action of breaking the bread.</p>
                  <p>Laſty, here the Communicants muſt obſerue, that when the bread is broken, and the wine powred out, they ſhould then ſtir vp their hearts to meditate vpon the paines &amp; Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt, and apply the ſame to their ſoules as a ſoueraigne cordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all of comfort.

                  <p>The fourth action of our Sauiour
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:10095:73"/> is, the giuing of the Bread and the Cup.

                  <p>This action is of great moment, for it repreſenteth GOD the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giuing his Sonne to vs, with all the merits of his painfull Paſſion and perfect obedience.<note place="margin">Ioh. 6.27.</note> 
                     <hi>Him hath GOD ſealed,</hi> as it is in the ſixt of <hi>Iohn.</hi> As God by his eternall decree did or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine Chriſt Ieſus to be our Sauiour, <hi>who is the Lambe ſlaine from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the world:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Reu. 5.12.</note> So hath hee ſealed vp this mercy vnto vs, in giuing vs the Sacrament.<note place="margin">1. Ioh. 4.10</note> 
                     <hi>And here is that loue of God, that he ſent his Sonne to be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation for our ſinnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This action yeelds matter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, of conſolation, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. Firſt, from the perſon and action meeting together, namely, Chriſt giuing the Sacrament, I may well collect that it belongs onely to
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:10095:74"/> the Miniſter, who is Chriſts ſubſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, to giue the Sacrament. As none but he may take, bleſſe, and breake the Bread,<note place="margin">Canon 21.</note> ſo none but he may deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer it; according to the Conſtitution of our Church.</p>
                  <p>As God by a ſpeciall ordinance in time of the Law,<note place="margin">Nu. 3.10.

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:10095:74"/> and his reaſon abſurd. For although the applying cauſe doth not of it ſelfe concurre to the producing of the effect, yet by accident, and the ordinance of God it may and doth. Had any man beſide <hi>Ananias</hi> put his hands vpon <hi>Pauls</hi> eyes, hee ſhould not thereby haue receiued his ſight. But <hi>Ananias,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Act. 9.17.</note> being ordained by Chriſt for that imployment, his hands were the effectuall applicant cauſe to conferre ſight to the bleſſed Conuert.</p>
                  <p>It is obiected by ſome, that our Sauiour ſaid to his Diſciples, concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the Cuppe,<note place="margin">Luk. 22.17</note>

                  <p>Againe, this condemnes that lur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching ſacrifice, wherin oft times the Prieſt giues none to others, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains all to himſelf. What is this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, but the lighting of a candle to

And in this wee muſt imitate our Sauiour Chriſt,<note place="margin">Compare Pſa. 68.18. with Ephe. 4.8.</note> who receiued gifts, that hee might giue them.</p>
                  <p>It is no leſſe abſurd for a man to affirme, that another ſhould receiue good by the Prieſts receiuing, (as the Rhemiſts teach) then to hold, that he may be fed by the meat ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man eates, or be ſaued by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mans faith: which conceits were very abſurd and ridiculous: For a man muſt be nouriſhed by his owne meate,<note place="margin">H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </note> doe put the Sacrament into the mouthes, not giue it into the hands of the Communicants. Yea, their ſcrupulous niceneſſe, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, that they ſhould not willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly touch it with their teeth, but only diſſolue it with their tongues. Whereof I know not what reaſon can be rendred, except they doubt the deuill might be in their Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſt, and doe ſome miſchiefe to the receiuer for byting of him; as it is in the fabulous ſtory of <hi>Gregories,</hi> ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the Rhemiſts:<note place="margin">Rhem. An. in <hi>1.</hi> Tim. <hi>4.5.</hi>
                     </note> where the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill entring into a woman that bit

                     </note> and beeing reprooued for it, anſwered, <hi>What haue I done? I did but ſit vpon the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and ſhe came and bit me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Secondly, as this doctrine yeelds matter of confutation, ſo doth it alſo of conſolation. For here is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the beſt and greateſt gift that euer was giuen to the ſonnes of men, euen the Sonne of GOD himſelfe. That is a great gift which <hi>Zaccheus</hi> ſpake of,<note place="margin">Lk. 19.8.</note> 
                     <hi>Behold, the one halfe of my goods I giue to the poore.</hi> That is a greater which <hi>Herod</hi> promiſed to the dancing Damſell,<note place="margin">Mar. 6.23.</note> 
                     <hi>VVhatſoeuer thou ſhalt aske of mee, behold, I will giue it, euen to the halfe of my King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> But that the greateſt of all, which that prodigall giuer offers to our Sauiour,<note place="margin">Math. 6.9.</note> when ſhewing him all the Kingdomes of the world, hee ſaid, <hi>All theſe will I giue thee, if thou wilt fall downe and worſhip me.</hi> Yet behold all thoſe gifts, had they been in their purpoſe and power to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, are of infinite leſſe value then this tranſcendent gift. Therefore St.
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:10095:77"/> 
                     <hi>Iohn,</hi> when hee ſpeakes of it,<note place="margin">Ioh. 3.16.</note> doth ſingle and ſet it forth with an Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaſis, <hi>Sic Deus dilexit mundum, So God loued the world:</hi> whereupon <hi>Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoſtome</hi> ſaith, <hi>Sic Deus dilexit? Did God ſo loue the world?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Chryſoſt. in Gen. ho. <hi>27.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Dic beate Iohan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, quomodo ſic?</hi> tell vs, O bleſſed <hi>Iohn,</hi> how was that <hi>So?</hi> Euen that which followeth, <hi>So God loued the world, that he gaue his onely begotten Sonno, that whoſoeuer beleeued in him, ſhould not periſh, but haue euerlaſting life.</hi> Loe here the greateſt gift that heauen could yeeld, or the earth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. Bleſſed therefore be the Giuer, and bleſſed be the gift for euermore.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, this giuing of Chriſt in the Sacrament, yeelds matter of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. For this gift of God to vs muſt ſtirre vp our hearts and hands to giue praiſe and thankes to him, and to ſtudy with the Prophet what wee ſhould <hi>render to the Lord for this admirable benefit:</hi> yea,<note place="margin">Pſ. 116.12.</note> ſeeing <hi>God hath not ſpared his owne Sonne,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ro. 8.32.</note> 
                     <hi>but giuen him for vs to death,</hi> we ſhould thinke nothing too deare for the teſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:10095:78"/> of our thankefulneſſe. We are bound <hi>by the mercies of God,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 12.1.</note> 
                     <hi>to giue vp our bodies a liuing ſacrifice to him.</hi> Euen to conſecrate our ſelues, our ſoules and bodies, and all that we haue and are, to his ſeruice, who hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed vnto vs forth of his aboun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant mercy, this ineſtimable gift to our exceeding comfort.</p>
                  <p>The fift action of Chriſt, and conſequently of the Miniſter, is that which I call verball, as comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding words of promiſe; <hi>This is my body which is giuen for you; This cup is the new Teſtament in my bloud, which is ſhed for you.</hi> In which our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sauiour doth neceſſarily ſhew the vſe &amp; benefit of the Sacrament, performing therein the office of a carefull Phyſician, in preparing a medicine, preſcribing to his Patient the vſe, &amp; ſhewing the vertue of it. Neceſſarily I ſay, for albeit the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments are <hi>viſible words,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Aug. in John. tract. <hi>79.</hi>
                     </note> yet muſt they alſo haue audible words annex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to demonſtrate the vſe of them; elſe will they be but dumbe ſhewes.
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:10095:78"/> Which preſident of Chriſts doth iuſtifie the practice of our Church, that appointed thoſe words to be v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the deliuery of the Sacrament. If any man obiect, he knowes theſe things before; I anſwere that our weakeneſſe conſidered, we had need not onely to haue the vnderſtanding informed, but the memory alſo reui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, and the affections ſtirred vp for our better meditation of theſe my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries. So that this ſtirring of vs vp by theſe words, may be like the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels ſtirring the people of Betheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,<note place="margin">Ioh. 5.4.</note> that the Sacrament may yeelde vertue for the cure and comfort of our ſoules.</p>
                  <p>In this verball action I will brief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly explane the words. Concerning the firſt, <hi>This is my body,</hi> I haue ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by conference of Scriptures, and teſtimony of Fathers, that the ſame are a tropicall ſpeech, and import thus much, <hi>This is a figure, a ſigne, a repreſentation of my body.</hi> In the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there are diuers tropes. Firſt, where hee ſaith, <hi>This cup is the new
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:10095:79"/> Teſtament in my blood.</hi> Euery one knowes there is a metonymy of the ſubiect, the cup being taken for that which is in the cup.</p>
                  <p>Againe, there is another trope in the word <hi>Teſtament:</hi> For the cup or wine in the cup is the Teſtament, onely as Circumciſion is the Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant; that is, a ſigne of the Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. And indeede this Teſtament and Couenant are both one: and ſo the Hebrew word <hi>Berith,</hi> and the Greeke <hi>Diatheke</hi> doe ſignifie: For that which is called <hi>Berith,</hi> a Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant;<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 17.10.</note> is called <hi>Diatheke,</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Acts. 7.8 <hi>And Hieron. in Zach.</hi> 9.11. renders the word <hi>Berith. teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>.</hi> And in his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition he ſaith, <hi>Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentiſiue pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cti tui.</hi> Heb. 9.10. <hi>Homers Illia.</hi>
                     </note> a Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The reaſon of this appellation ariſeth partly forth of Sacramentall phraſes, partly from of a reference and reſemblance of <hi>Moſes</hi> ſpeech, when ſprinkling the bloud, he calls it the bloud of the Teſtament.</p>
                  <p>Neither is this manner of ſpeech a ſtranger to humane writers: For <hi>Homer</hi> calls their ſacrifices <gap reason="foreign">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap>, the faithfull leagues of their gods. But here it may be queſtioned why it is called the new Teſtament,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:10095:79"/> or Couenant,<note place="margin">Gen. 3.15. Gen. 17.2. Act. 10.23</note> ſeeing the ſame is very ancient, being made in Paradiſe to <hi>Adam,</hi> renewed to <hi>Abraham,</hi> wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed by the Prophets, figured in the ſacrifices? I anſwer, it may be called a new Couenant in diuers reſpects.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in regard of the matter, the one being a Couenant of works, the other of Grace.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, in regard of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and ſo it is the new Couenant, as our Sauiour calls his precept of Loue, A new commandement.<note place="margin">Ioh. 13.34</note> For as that commandement is called a new commandement, becauſe it is newly reuiued, and more effectually vrged then before: ſo this Couenant may be called a new Couenant, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it is more plainely renewed, &amp; more powerfully confirmed to the Church of God.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is called the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenant, in regard of the Miniſter; for <hi>Moſes</hi> was Miniſter and Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the old Teſtament, being the ſeruant of God: but Chriſt is the Miniſter and Mediator of the new
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:10095:80"/> Teſtament, beeing the Sonne of God.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, it is ſo called in regard of time, the one containing a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, the other ſhewing an accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment thereof; the one premon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrating Chriſt to come, the other demonſtrating him already come.</p>
                  <p>Fiftly, in regard of the new forme or ceremonies wherin it is ſet forth: Not in thoſe legall types, as the bloud of Buls and Goates, but in the elements of bread and wine, which doe liuely repreſent the body and bloud of the Sonne of God as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſpot.<note place="margin">Heb. 9.11.12.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus the words being cleared; From hence we may infer, that ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Sacrament is called the Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Chriſt, wee muſt haue the hand of faith to aprrehend it. For there is a mutuall relation betweene <hi>ſides</hi> &amp; <hi>foedus:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>. 5.2.</note> as <hi>Aſſuerus</hi> holds out his golden Scepter, ſo Queene <hi>Hester</hi> muſt draw neere and touch the top of it; as God tenders to vs a Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of mercy, ſo wee muſt reach
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:10095:80"/> forth the hand of Faith to lay hold vpon it. Yea, this Couenant requires alſo the hand of obedience. For there muſt be a mutuall ſtipulation concurring betwixt God and man in this caſe. As God doth couenant with <hi>Abraham</hi> to be his all-ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient God:<note place="margin">Gen. 17.1.</note> So <hi>Abraham</hi> muſt coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>to walke before God and be vpright.</hi> Now if we haue this hand of Faith to apprehend, and this hand of Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to demonſtrate our appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, then happy and thrice hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py are we,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 1.20.</note> all the promiſes and Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uenants of <hi>God ſhall be to vs in Chriſt Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, yea and Amen.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus much for the actions of the Paſtor. Now to the Actions of the people, wherein I will be briefe, in regard that what concernes them, is in ſome ſort handled (by reaſon of relation) in the actions of the Miniſter.</p>
                  <p>The firſt of theſe actions is the ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Sacrament. This action is of great vſe, and therefore men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned by all the Euangeliſts.</p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:10095:81"/>
                  <p>It ſignifies our apprehending of Chriſt, with the merits of his death and paſſion. And indeed what auai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the preparation and ſanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the elements, if they be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued? Hence I obſerue; firſt, that it is no arbitrary thing whether we receiue the Sacrament or not, ſeeing we are enioyned it by vertue of this precept, <hi>Take, eate.</hi> The Centurion ſaid to our Sauiour, <hi>ſpeake the word onely,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 8.9.</note> 
                     <hi>and my ſeruant ſhall be whole:</hi> Now Chriſt hath ſpoken the word, and commanded vs to take the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, therefore we ſhould doe it. But here we may obſerue (as it is in the ſpeech of the Centurion) not onely Chriſts precept, but our bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit alſo, which is maruailous great. The ſeruants of <hi>Naaman</hi> ſaid well vnto him,<note place="margin">1. Reg. 5.13.</note> 
                     <hi>If the Prophet had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded thee a greater matter, ſhouldeſt thou not haue done it? how much more when he ſaith, Waſh and bee cleane?</hi> So may I ſay, My brethren, if wee had onely Chriſts co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>mandement, ſhould we not obey it? how much more,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:10095:81"/> when much comfort is to be obtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in obeying the commandement? The want of this taking in many may iuſtly cauſe the Prophets com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint,<note place="margin">Eſa. 6.47.</note> 
                     <hi>There is none that ſtirred vp himſelfe to take hold on thee.</hi> The wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full fruit of which neglect, we may obſerue in the ſame place, when he ſaith, <hi>We doe fade like a leafe.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Verſ. 6.</note> As the body muſt needs pine away without foode, and the leafe wither, without the Sunne and ſappe to nouriſh it: ſo without laying hold vpon Chriſt, that vertue may proceed from him to be as foode and ſap to our ſoules, they muſt needs decay and famiſh. That is a heauenly proclamation;<note place="margin">Reu. 22.17</note> 
                     <hi>Let whoſo will come and take of the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of life freely;</hi> but that is a heauy complaint, <hi>He came amongſt his own,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 1.11.</note> 
                     <hi>but his owne receiued him not.</hi> And this complaint falls as a iuſt reproofe vpon them, who refuſe to take the bleſſed Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>Againe, here it muſt be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred, that we bring the hand of Faith, when we come to the Table
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:10095:82"/> of the Lord. Our hearts and hands in receiuing of the Sacrament, muſt be like two buckets in a well, one going vp, when another is going downe. Whileſt the hand of our bodies goes down to take the bread &amp; wine, the hand of our ſoule muſt goe vp to Chriſt in heauen to lay hold on him. To which purpoſe St. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith well,<note place="margin">Aug. in Ioh. tract. <hi>25.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>Quid paras den<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes? VVhy doſt thou prepare thy teeth &amp; thy belly? Prepare thy minde: Beleeue, &amp; thou haſt eaten.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Againe, in this caſe it is our duty to be as ready to giue as to take. As we receiue the bleſſings of God, ſo muſt we returne our praiſe &amp; thanks vnto him. As the bird when ſhee takes a drop of water, lifts vp her head and her eyes: So we, when we taſte of theſe mercies, muſt lift vp our hearts &amp; hands with all thanke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſſe to our gracious God the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer of all good gifts, and not be like the ſwine, which deuoures the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cornes, but neuer lookes vp to the tree from whence they fell.</p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:10095:82"/>
                  <p>The ſecond Action of the people is <hi>the eating of the bread, and drinking of the wine.</hi> This action alſo is very neceſſary, being very ſignificant, as that which comprehends the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular applying of Chriſt to euery communicant. For as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith,<note place="margin">Aug. contra Fauſt. Mani. lib. <hi>20.</hi> c. <hi>21.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>This is the eating of Chriſt, the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating of his Paſſion, with a ſweet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance that his body was crucified, &amp; his bloud ſhed for our ſinnes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To eate and drinke, is oft in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture phraſe transferred from the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to the minde, as in the ſixt of <hi>Iohn,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 6.53.</note> 
                     <hi>Except you eate the fleſh of the Sonne of Man, and drinke his bloud, you haue no life in you:</hi> and very fitly; for as our bodies are nouriſhed by eating of corporall meates; ſo our ſoules are nouriſhed by the ſpirituall feeding vpon Chriſt. Hence it comes to paſſe that Chriſt dwels in vs,<note place="margin">Eph. 3.17.</note> and we are made the Temples of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt. For we abide in Chriſt, as S. <hi>Auſtin</hi> ſaith, when we are made his members, and <hi>he abides in vs,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Aug. in Ioh. tract. <hi>27.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <hi>when we become his Temples.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="148" facs="tcp:10095:83"/>
                  <p>Now this action, and the other doe meet with diuers corruptions in the Church of Rome, whoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption diſcards her from being the Spouſe of Chriſt. For ſhe is ſtill tampering with his ordinances, abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing what he hath ordained, and eſtabliſhing what her ſelfe hath de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſed: which is no leſſe then to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance her ſelfe in wiſedome and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority aboue the Sonne of God.</p>
                  <p>What ground of Scripture hath ſhe for her idolatrous adoration? the Sacrament was ordained to be taken and eaten, not to be adored. What warrant hath ſhe to make the Prieſt the onely actor, &amp; the people meere ſpectators, in the celebration of the Sacrament; ſeeing that taking and eating are the conſequents of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecration? What an abſurdity is it to inuite men to a banquet, and not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer them to taſte a bit? Doth ſhe not in witholding from the people the participation of the Sacrame<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t, bring vpon them that iudgement inflicted vpon the incredulous ruler, who did
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:10095:83"/> onely ſee the plenty prophecied of by <hi>Eliſha,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Kin. 7.19</note> but did not eate there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of?</p>
                  <p>The Councell of Trent would wiſh that thoſe who are preſent ſhould alwayes communicate,<note place="margin">Concil. Trid. ſeſſ. <hi>22.</hi> c. <hi>6.</hi>
                     </note> that they <hi>might thereby receiue more fruit by the Sacrament.</hi> But either they diſſemble in this wiſh, or elſe their people are very diſobedient in their practice; that amongſt ſo many as are vſually preſent at their Maſſes, none of them ſhould haue care to communicate.</p>
                  <p>Againe, theſe actions of eating and drinking doe giue a wound to their carnall preſence. For as they are fit actions for bread and wine; ſo are they; altogether vnfit for fleſh and bloud.<note place="margin">Aug de doct. Chriſt. lib. <hi>3.</hi> cap. <hi>16.</hi>
                     </note> Therefore Saint <hi>Auſtins</hi> rule is good, <hi>Si Locutio ſit flagitium iubens, &amp;c. If there be a ſpeech in the Scripture which commandeth ſome wicked act, it is a figuratiue ſpeech;</hi> and he giues his inſtance euen in this eating and drinking the body and bloud of Chriſt. If this ſpeech were
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:10095:84"/> not figuratiue, the act were odious, <hi>for it is more horrible and inhumane to eate mans fleſh then to kill it,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Aug. contra aduerſ. leg. &amp; Prophet. li. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>9.</hi>
                     </note>

                  <p>That euaſion of the Catechiſme of Trent, is too poore a couer for this foule corruption. It was Gods eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall prouidence, that the body and bloud of Chriſt ſhould not be eaten and drunken in their kindes, becauſe humane nature abhors it.

                  <p>But to leaue matter of controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie, and conclude this point; let eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one haue care when he eates the bleſſed Sacrament, to apply Chriſt
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:10095:84"/> to his ſoule effectually, and to ſay with <hi>Thomas, My Lord and my God.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 20.28.</note> For it is not enough to haue a ſoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne cordiall, except it be receiued; It is not enough to know that the death of Chriſt is meritorious, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it be applyed: therefore wee muſt apply Chriſt to our ſoules in the Sacrament,<note place="margin">2.

                  <p>Theſe words <hi>as oft</hi> are here twice vſed, and there may be diuers rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for the ſame. Firſt, to put a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference betweene the Paſſeouer and the Supper. The Paſſeouer was ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrated
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:10095:92"/> but once a yeere, and at one certaine time of the yeere; but the Supper of the Lord may be admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred many times, and at any time of the yeere.</p>
                  <p>And herein alſo this Sacrament differs from Baptiſme, which is on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly once adminiſtred, and not itera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and reaſon, for as it is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent that we be once borne into the World, but neceſſary that wee be often fedde: ſo is it ſufficient, that wee doe once receiue Baptiſme, the Sacrament of our new birth, but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry expedient that wee oft receiue the Euchariſt, the food and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our ſoules.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, as theſe words may ſerue to diſtinguiſh betweene this and the other Sacraments: ſo may they alſo very aptly carry with them an intimation of receiuing often. Firſt, in that the Apoſtle ſaith not, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </note> to require that at leaſt once a yeere the people receiue the Sacrament</p>
                  <p>But in this variety of practice, we muſt for our better guidance obſerue the circumſtances of neceſſity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueniency, and vtility. For the firſt, tis true that we haue daily neede of the remembrance of Chriſts death, and conſequently of the Sacrament. As our bodies haue daily neede of nouriſhment by our corporall food, ſo haue our ſoules by our ſpirituall. Yet muſt not this be the onely guide or ground of our receiuing; but we muſt alſo haue reſpect to conueni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency. For ſeeing there is required a due and diligent preparation for the receiuing of this Sacrament, the ſame muſt moderate our neceſſity: ſo that we ſhould as well look to our fitneſſe, as our need. But yet in the third place, the due conſideration of
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:10095:94"/> the ineſtimable benefit and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort we obtaine by receiuing the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament, muſt ſtirre vs vp, ſo oft as with conuenience we may, to bee partakers of this bleſſed banquet; that if it were poſſible, we might e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery day be fit to communicate, as St. <hi>Ambroſe</hi> doth exhort:<note place="margin">Sic viue, vt quotiaie me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rearis accipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re. Ambr de ſacra. l. <hi>5.</hi> c. <hi>4</hi>
                     </note> That ſo we may, as neere as our fraile nature will permit, reſemble thoſe bleſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But it is obiected, that as familia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity breedes contempt: ſo, frequent receiuing may cauſe a diſeſtimation of the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>To which I anſwere. Firſt, it is not like, that what God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained as a meanes to increaſe and kindle zeale, ſhould bee a cauſe to coole or quench it. And if it be an occaſion onely, diuine ordinances muſt not be neglected for humane corruptions.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, albeit amongſt ſome men much ſamiliarity hath this ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect;
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:10095:94"/> yet it is not ſo amongſt thoſe who are wiſe and intimate: for their daily familiarity confirmes their bond of loue.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, though we may weary men by often comming to their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles: yet the often we come to the Lords Table, the better welcome wee are, ſo that we come prepared; without which preparation, I ſay not once a yeere, but euen once in our liues is too oft. Therefore Saint <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſpeaking of ſome who once a yeere would be ſure to come (whether prepared or vnprepared) becauſe of the feſtiuall time,<note place="margin">Chryſ. ad <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In a word, Satan will endeuour to keepe vs both from preparing, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating: but we ought ſo much the more diligently to ſtirre vp our ſelues, to preparation and receiuing the Sacrament.</p>
                  <p>Thus hauing ſatisfied that qu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="172" facs="tcp:10095:95"/> concerning the time, wee will now conſider the particular end of celebrating the Sacrament, which is the ſhewing of Chriſts death, as his death is an Epitome of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell. Neuer did God ſet ſo remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble remembrances vpon any thing ſince the foundations of the world were layd, as he hath done vpon the death and Paſſion of our bleſſed Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour; the heauens were darkened, the earth trembled, the graues ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the vaile of the Temple rented, the dead were raiſed; and therefore it is no maruell, that he hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained the Sacraments for a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall thereof to the end of the world. Now as men who haue payed debts in diuers particular ſummes, will be carefull for their diſcharge, to keep the particular acquitances: So eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part of Chriſts death beeing as a particular acquittance for the debt of our ſinnes, it will be very expedient for vs to take notice thereof, and to lay them vp carefully in our hearts for our comfort.</p>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:10095:95"/>
                  <p>When we ſpeake of the death of Chriſt, we muſt not conſider it as the expiring of his ſoule onely: but his death with all the concomitants of his Paſſion. And though his whole life was a continued paſſion; yet will I onely obſerue thoſe things which he ſuffered the night that he was betrayed, and the day that he was crucified. And this I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider in fiue generall paſſages, as it were fiue tragicall Acts, hauing in them many dolefull Scenes. 1. His agony in the garden. 2.

                     <hi>but to haue it when he is preſent, it is very ſuperfluous.</hi> Therefore our Sauiour did not inſtitute the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment till he was departing out of the World. And in that the Sacrament

I will mention two or three. Firſt, as in the Sacrament we ſee the death of Chriſt, ſo in the death of Chriſt we muſt take a view of our ſinnes, and be ſtirred vp to remorſe and ſerious ſorrow for the
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:10095:107"/> ſame. For, had not our ſinnes made way to it, neither could <hi>Iudas</hi> haue betrayed him, the high Prieſts accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him, the people ſcoft him, the Souldiers ſcourg'd him, <hi>Pilate</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned him, nor the Iewes haue crucified him. Our ſinnes were the thornes, the whips, the ſpeares, the nayles that pierced and wounded the ſoule of our Sauiour. And iuſtly therefore ſhould our ſoules be pier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced with ſorrow for the ſame. Shall Chriſt ſmart for thy ſinnes, &amp; ſhall not thy heart ſmart and ſmite thee for them?<note place="margin">Luk. 23.48.</note> When the people, that came to behold the Paſſion of Chriſt, ſaw what was done at his death, they ſmote their breſts in ſigne of ſorrow. So euery Chriſtian, when he ſees the Sacrament, a memoriall of Chriſts death and Paſſion, ſhould with the penitent Publican ſmite his breſt with the hand of compuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſay,<note place="margin">Luk. 18.13.</note> 
                     <hi>O God be mercifull to mee a ſinner.</hi> And if our hearts cannot in the meditation of theſe things be touched with remorſe, the earth
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:10095:107"/> which trembled, the rockes which rented, the graues which opened, ſhall one day riſe vp in iudgement againſt vs.</p>
                  <p>Againe, the meditations of theſe things may bee a notable meanes to ſtirre vs vp to thankefull obedience. Chriſt hath ſhewed the greateſt loue that may bee in dying for vs. <hi>For greater loue can no man ſhew, then to lay downe his life for his friends.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 15.13.</note> Yet I may ſay with <hi>Bernard,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Bern. de paſſi Dom.</note> 
                     <hi>Etiam tu Domine maiorem habuiſti. O bleſſed Lord, thou haſt had greater: for thou haſt layd downe thy life for thine ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</hi> Therefore ſhould euery one that lookes for an intereſt in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary fauor, ſay with the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophet, <hi>My ſoule praiſe thou the Lord,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 103.1.</note> 
                     <hi>and all that is within me praiſe his holy name.</hi> Let all that is within me and without mee, magnifie him for his mercies: let all that I haue, and am, be deuoted to his ſeruice. As Chriſt hath thought nothing too deare for vs, no not his bloud, his life; as hee hath thought no paines
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:10095:108"/> too great, not his bloudy agony, his torments on the Croſſe; ſo let vs thinke, all the coſt wee can expend, and all the paines we can take, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly too little to bee employed in his ſeruice.</p>
                  <p>Againe, here is matter of much comfort. Let no man think it ſtrange that theſe contrarie ſtreames of ioy and ſorrow ſhould ariſe both out of one fountaine. For wee muſt come to the Sacraments,<note place="margin">Mat. 28.8.</note> as the <hi>Maries</hi> came from the Sepulchre, with feare and <hi>much ioy.</hi> As wee muſt ſorrow, that our ſinnes were the cauſe of Chriſts death: ſo muſt wee reioyce, that Chriſts death is the meanes to eternall life. Hence we obtain victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie ouer Satan,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 15.57. Heb. 2.14.15. Heb. 9.17.</note> death and hell. Hence wee haue tendred to God full ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction for our ſinnes. Hence wee haue an intereſt in the legacy of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life, and for pledge of this lega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, wee haue the bleſſed Sacrament.

                     <hi>Chriſt was poore, that wee might be rich:</hi> So I may ſay, He was humbled, that wee might be exalted; hee was diſgra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, that wee might be honoured; he was wounded, that we might be healed; he was condemned, that we might be acquited; he ware a crown of thornes, that wee might haue a Crowne of glory; hee complained that he was forſaken, that we might be aſſured our God will neuer for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake vs; he was <hi>numbred among the wicked,</hi> that wee might enioy the ſociety of Saints &amp; Angels for euer. Therefore my brethren, let this bee the ſolace of your ſoules, and the ioy of your hearts, againſt all the afflictions of this life, the terrors of death, and the torments of hell.</p>

                  <p>Hereunto it may be obiected, We doe not read that the Word of God being peruerted or abuſed, doth incurre ſuch danger, or draw downe ſuch iudgements: how comes it then to paſſe, that the Sacrament be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing profaned, ſhould bee ſo dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous,

                  <p>For the better proſecution of this point, we will conſider theſe three circumſtances. 1. The perſons who: 2. The manner how: 3. The matter whereof this examination conſiſts.</p>

                  <p>There is a maruailous difference betweene Examination and Confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and it is impoſſible to conclude the one from the other.

                  <p>But leauing that erronious col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, we may from hence inferre directly, that foraſmuch as euery one who comes to the Sacrament muſt examine himſelfe; children, fooles, and madmen, and all thoſe, who are altogether diſabled by nature, for this examination, are by no meanes

<pb n="295" facs="tcp:10095:156"/> the Euchariſt, it being a Sacrament of Thanksgiuing.

                  <p>For the firſt point I reaſon thus.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All things indifferent which are to be vſed in the ſeruice of God, are in the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spoſition of the Church.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>The geſture in the Act of receiuing the Sacrament is a thing indifferent, and to be vſed in the ſeruice of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Therefore the geſture in the Act of receiuing the Sacrament, is in the diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of the Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The propoſition is the generall iudgement of Diuines, both ancient and moderne. So that to ſpend time in proofe thereof, were to ſet vp a candle to helpe the light of the Sun at noone.</p>
                  <p>And the aſſumption is alſo as plaine, by the generall deſcription of things indifferent.</p>
                  <p>For, <hi>Thoſe things which haue nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther precept, prohibition, nor expreſſe determination in the Scriptures, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>But the geſture in the act of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing the Sacrament, hath neither pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept, prohibition, nor expreſſe determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in the Scriptures. Therefore
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:10095:158"/> the geſture in the act of receiuing the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament is indifferent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The very quotation of learned Diuines for proofe of this propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the other in the former ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, would fill many ſheetes of paper. Yea theſe things are ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall and euident truths,<note place="margin">His firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply pag. 18.</note> that Maſter <hi>Cartwright</hi> himſelfe ſaith, <hi>I know no man that euer denied, that the Church may make orders, in ſuch things as are not ſpecified, and preciſely determined in the Word.</hi> In which words he inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mateth what are things indifferent; namely ſuch things as are not ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and preciſely determined in the Word: and then, that the Church may determine or make orders con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſame: and ſo acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeth all that goes before.</p>
                  <p>Now for further proofe of the laſt aſſumption, I confidently affirm, and ſhall, I doubt not, euidently ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt, that there is neither precept, prohibition, nor precedent in the Scriptures concerning the geſture in the Act of receiuing.</p>
                  <pb n="300" facs="tcp:10095:159"/>
                  <p>And albeit it were ſufficient to prooue the matter of indifferency, that there is no precept, prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or preciſe determination there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of (as Maſter <hi>Cartwright</hi> ſpeakes:) yet becauſe the Inſtitution of Chriſt is ſo much in euery ones mouth, I will make it euident by the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, that nothing herein is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, ſo much as by any practice or precedent of our Sauiour, or his ſeruants the Apoſtles.</p>
                  <p>If it be obiected that learned men writing in defence of kneeling, haue let it paſſe by way of conceſſion, that Chriſt ſate at the Sacrament:</p>
                  <p>To this I anſwere, that peraduen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture they haue not ſo ſeriouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered all the ſeries of the ſacred ſtory. Or it may be they haue not very carefully regarded it, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that if Chriſts ſitting were gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, yet it doth not inforce any ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of imitation,<note place="margin">Page 223.

                     </note> as afterwards ſhall appeare.</p>
                  <p>But for my owne part, as a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man, when the Papiſts vrge <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi>

And this ſhall appeare by the examination of thoſe paſſages of Scripture which mention the Inſtitution.</p>
                  <p>Firſt St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 13.23.</note> who handles the doctrine of the Sacrament at large, hath not one word concerning any geſture.</p>
                  <p>Again, all the Euangeliſts,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.20. Mat. 14.17. Luk. 22.14. Ioh. 13.12, &amp;c.</note> though their teſtimony be produced, are vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly ſilent in this matter. For, whereas they mention Chriſts ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe with his Diſciples,
<pb n="302" facs="tcp:10095:160"/> that was at the Paſſeouer.</p>
                  <p>This ſhall be euident to any man that looks diligently into the ſtory. Two of the Euangeliſts, namely, <hi>Mathew</hi> and <hi>Marke,</hi> are very like in relating the celebration of the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, and the inſtitution of the Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ſo that to haue ſhewed what one ſaith, is to ſhew what both ſay. Saint <hi>Mathew,</hi> chap. 26. hauing mentioned Chriſts ſending of his Diſciples to prepare a place for the Paſſeouer,<note place="margin">Mat. 26.19.</note> ſaith verſe 19. <hi>And the Diſciples did as Ieſus had commanded them, and made ready the Paſſeouer. So when euen was come, hee ſate downe with the twelue. And as they did eate, he ſaid vnto them, Verily I ſay vnto you, that one of you ſhall betray me. And they were exceeding ſorrowfull, and began euery one of them to ſay, Is it I Maſter? And he anſwered and ſaid, He that dip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth his hand with me in the diſh, he ſhall betray me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here it is euident that this ſitting downe is at the Paſſeouer. For it was <hi>when the euening was come,</hi> according
<pb n="303" facs="tcp:10095:160"/> to the ordinance of Almighty God,<note place="margin">

                  <p>Againe, it was at that eating wherin one dipped with him in the diſh: which muſt needs bee at the Paſſeouer, the Supper yeelding no occaſion of dipping: for our Sauiour deliuered to euery one the bread and the cup ſeuerally. Therefore a lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned man ſaith truly,<note place="margin">Piſcat. in Mat. 26.20.</note> 
                     <hi>They are very much deceiued, who thinke that the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſt here ſpeakes not of she Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, but of the Supper.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now thought this might ſeeme ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient: yet S. <hi>Luke</hi> makes it plaine;<note place="margin">Luk. 22.13, 15.</note> for he ſaith, <hi>After the Paſſeouer was made ready, when the houre was come, he ſate downe, and the twelue Apoſtles with him; then he ſaid vnto them, I haue earneſtly deſired to eate this Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer with you.</hi> Here (to let paſſe that this ſitting downe was with the twelue, which could not be at the Supper, <hi>Iudas</hi> being ſent away pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently after hee receiued the ſop,
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:10095:161"/> which was at the Paſſeouer) a dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble circumſtance of time doth euict,<note place="margin">Ioh. 13.30.</note> that it was at the Paſſouer. For firſt it is ſaid, When the houre (meaning the time preſcribed by Almighty God) was come, Chriſt ſate downe, which cannot bee vnderſtood of Chriſts laſt Supper: for there was no direct time appointed for inſtitution or celebration thereof; but the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer was by diuine Inſtitution to be celebrated in the euening of the foureteenth day of the moneth <hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſan.</hi> Secondly, the Euangeliſt ſaith, that when Chriſt ſate downe, then he ſaid, <hi>I haue deſired to eat this Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer with you.</hi> Whereby it appeares that it was not the Euchariſt, but the Paſſeouer that he had in hand pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently vpon his ſitting downe. And in the verſes next following, hee ſhewes the celebration of the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer, and afterwards ſpeakes of the Inſtitution of the Supper, without mention of the geſture.</p>
                  <p>The fourth place alleaged for Chriſts ſitting at the Supper, is the
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:10095:161"/> thirteenth of <hi>Iohn:</hi> which is a place indeed very excellent to confirme what hath beene deliuered concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the narrations of the other E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſts. In this Chapter there is mention made of Chriſts ſitting downe twice: his firſt ſitting is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated verſ. 4. his ſecond is plainely expreſſed, verſ. 12. But what? at the Supper of the Lord? Surely no, but at the Paſſeouer. For euidence wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I will ſhew the manner of the Iewes celebrating of the Paſſeouer, as it is ſet downe by him who hath collected it from <hi>Paulus Burgenſis</hi> a very learned man;<note place="margin">Iohn 13. <hi>Beza in Mat.</hi> 26.20.</note> from <hi>Emanuel Tremelius</hi> a Iew by birth, but through Gods mercy a learned Chriſtian by education; and from <hi>Ioſephus Scaliger</hi> (beſides all other excellent learning) a profound An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquary, and it is thus.</p>
                  <p>At the time appointed for the Paſſeouer, there did vſe to meet at the leaſt, ten in a chamber, and there ſitting, after a certaine faſhion, did eate a Lambe roſted, with vleaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:10095:162"/> bread; which being done, they roſe from table &amp; waſhed their feet: and after that ſate downe againe to an after-ſupper, as it were a ſecond courſe, whereat they had vnleaue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned bread, and ſalets of Succory and Lettice, mixed with a certaine kinde of ſauce. The Maſter of the family diuided the bread into two parts, and firſt he bleſſed the one, ſaying, <hi>Bleſſed art thou, O Lord God, in the ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of vnleauened bread.</hi> And the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part (which he had put vnder a napkin) he brought forth at the end of the banquet, and diuiding it into ſo many parts as there were perſons, deliuered it and ſaid, <hi>This is the bread of ſorrow which our Fathers did eate in Aegypt:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Paſchatizet.</note> 
                     <hi>Whoſoeuer hath need, let him come and take the Paſſeouer.</hi> And af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, taking the Cup, hee ſaid; <hi>Bleſſed art thou, O Lord, who haſt crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the fruit of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ine:</hi> and ſo it was deliuered from one to another. After all which things finiſhed, they ſung diuers Pſalmes, and ſo depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                  <pb n="307" facs="tcp:10095:162"/>
                  <p>In this manner of celebrating the Paſſeouer, wee may obſerue diuers particulars. Firſt, that our Sauiours firſt ſitting downe, intimated in the fourth verſe, was for the eating of the Paſchall Lambe.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, that his next ſitting downe, mentioned in the 12. and 28. verſes, was to the after-ſupper of the Salets and ſauce.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that it was at this ſecond Supper our Sauiour gaue <hi>Iudas</hi> the ſoppe (for there were no ſoppes at the Supper) which hauing recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, hee went forth immediatly, verſe 30.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that there was a great intermiſſion betweene the Paſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouer and the Supper, and ſo there might bee in the meane time any change of the geſture.</p>
                  <p>Now in all this diſcourſe, St. <hi>Iohn</hi> hath not one word concerning the inſtitution of the Supper, &amp; conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently nothing of the geſture: but the ſitting mentioned by him, doth directly belong to the Paſſeouer.</p>

                  <p>But here I would demand of them who plead for ſitting, whether that geſture can be free from this excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? If you take ſcandall for offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding &amp; grieuing others,<note place="margin">As Rom. 14.13, 15.</note> or for cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them to offend, by not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming to Chriſt, or by doing any thing againſt their Conſcience; cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſitting cannot be without ſcandall.

                  <p>And thirdly, for the crime of Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry imputed to thoſe that kneele in the act of receiuing, there can be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more abſurd. For we neither

                  <p>Thus the geſture of kneeling, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing moſt conſonant to comelineſſe and order, of it ſelfe not ſcandalous, and neither of it ſelfe, nor by our a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſe idolatrous, but onely orderly and pious, &amp; conſequently tending

                  <p>But let vs examine the reaſons of this poſition, the firſt wherof is this: <hi>It directeth our hearts to an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of disfellowſhip with Chriſt in our future eſtate of glory repreſented at the Lords Table,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>To this I anſwere, that there is great difference betweene our Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heyrſhip, and equality of fellowſhip with Chriſt. For though wee be now Coheyres with Chriſt <hi>through hope;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Tit. 3.7.</note> yet do we challenge no fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of equality with him, but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge our due ſubiection to him, as our Lord.</p>

                     <note place="margin">Ephe. 1.20.</note> So that if kneeling be a barre to our equality &amp; fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip (as well it may) yet is it not any hinderance to the apprehenſion of our Coheyreſhip with Chriſt, which is aſſured to vs of our bleſſed Sauiour by participation of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Sacrament, without conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, intention, or inſtitution of any geſture.

                     <hi>Becauſe it diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth our hearts from meditating on the death of Chriſt; for we cannot at the ſame time meditate and tender to God a worthy ſacrifice of prayer.</hi>

                  <p>Thirdly, it is conſiderable, that this holy Table and Banquet doe differ from others which are meerely ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, neither doe they yeeld vs thoſe priuiledges that the ciuill doe.</p>

                  <p>I anſwer; 1. This Argument con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnes directly thoſe Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions where the Sacrament is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued Standing: For whileſt ſome doe ſtand at the Table, others ſit in remote places, and are not appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſtand when the Receiuers ſtand: So that the Congregation not partaking with them in the act of Standing, they preſent a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate

                  <p n="2">2. It condemnes diuers Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations where the Sacrament is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued either Sitting or ſtanding. For in thoſe Churches wherein I haue ſeene moſt preciſeneſſe, in the time of the celebration of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whilſt ſome are receiuing, others are employed, either in ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Pſalmes, or hearing ſome Scripture read. Now theſe actions, of ſinging and reading the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, are more diſſonant from me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditation, then prayer is: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if the one be vnlawfull, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt needs be ſo. But thus, men forth of their inconſideration and diſpoſition to contend, care not whom they wound in defence of their owne conceits.</p>
                  <p>Yea, this condemnes all Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations in the world, vpon a ground of impoſſibility; For it is vſuall that ſome one, or few, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiuing whilſt others are not (which cannot poſſibly be otherwiſe, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept there were as many to deliuer
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:10095:178"/> the Sacrament, as there are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue it at the ſame inſtant:) So that the Congregation doth not, in your account, ioyntly partake in preſenting the ſame worſhip, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept you will ſay that bare medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vpon the Sacrament is the ſame that actuall receiuing is, and ſo ſhake hands with the Papiſts,<note place="margin">Bellar. de Miſſa, lib. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>9.</hi> Rhem.

                  <p>Laſtly, I may truely ſay, that this Argument is a meere Paradox, which, to auoid kneeling, excludes praying: Inſomuch that if a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municant, during the time of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:10095:179"/> adminiſtration, and after hee hath receiued the Sacrament, doe but beſeech God to bleſſe the ſame vnto him, that it may be a meanes to ſtrengthen his faith, to helpe him in the act of mortification, and building of him vp in grace, by this reaſon he ſhall ſin againſt God; then which, what can be more abſurd &amp; ſenſeleſſe?</p>
                  <p>
                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="6"/> To kneele at the Sacrament, is to leaue the imitable practice of Chriſt and his Apoſtles,<note place="margin">I deny both parts of the Argument.</note> and in lieu thereof to obſerue a worſe: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is vnlawfull.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reſp.</hi> In this Argument two things are to be conſidered. Firſt, whether we vary from the practice of Chriſt: and this I confidently deny; neither ſhall it be poſſible for any man, forth of the Scriptures, to proue directly what geſture Chriſt vſed at the inſtitution of the Supper.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, if it were granted, that our Sauiour, and his ſeruants the Apoſtles did celebrate and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:10095:179"/> it Sitting: Yet are not we ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily tyed to imitate them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in.</p>
                  <p>It is truely ſaid,<note place="margin">Diſpute p. 47.</note> that to <hi>reſtraine our imitation of Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, to euery particular circumſtance of their carriage, were againſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſenſe.</hi> And howſoeuer in Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall actions wee ought to follow Chriſt in matter of ſubſtance, yet are we not alwayes ſo in reſpect of circumſtance, eſpecially where there is no Precept. Now that the Geſture is not of the ſubſtance of the Sacrament, it is cleere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly euicted, in that neither the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uangeliſts, nor the Apoſtle, doth once mention it: For who dares af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firme that any ſubſtantiall matter is omitted by them, who haue hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the doctrine of the Sacrament moſt excellently and exactly?<note place="margin">Mal. 5.1. Mark. 4.1. Luk. 4.29. Iohn 5.2. <hi>Aug. ſerm. Domini in Mon. li.</hi> 1.</note> But to make this more euident by an inſtance. It was our Sauiours cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome to preach Sitting, as all the Euangeliſts doe ſhew, and S. <hi>Austin</hi> giues reaſon for it; namely, becauſe
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:10095:180"/> it doth very well ſort with the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of a Teacher: yet the moſt preciſe doe not imitate him therin, but vſe to ſtand when they preach, though the people ſit. Now (ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing that Chriſt ſate at the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Supper) if the generall practice in the one doth not tye vs to imitation: how can one indiui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duall act doe it in the other?</p>
                  <p>So that albeit wee ſhould grant, that our Sauiour and his Apoſtles did celebrate and receiue the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament ſitting: yet both by the Poſitions and practice of them who are our Oppoſites, wee are in this matter of circumſtance freed from neceſſity of imitation. Yea, if Sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting had beene Chriſts geſture, and wee bound to imitation, how durſt the ancient Churches, and diuers moderne Congregations make Standing their vſuall Geſture in ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrating the Sacrament: as you doe write of the one, and experience ſhewes of the other?</p>
                  <p>The ſeuenth Argument: <hi>Knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling

                  <p>If the worſhip at our receiuing, did determine in the Sacrament, or were tranſient by it to God; As the Romaniſts diuerſly hold con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the worſhip of their Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges,<note place="margin">Bellar. de J<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mag. ſanct. li. <hi>2.</hi> ca. <hi>20.21.</hi>

But foraſmuch as it is ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered immediately to God, there is no iuſt cauſe of condemning our pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice.

                  <p>This Argument vſed in the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute, is like <hi>Bellarmine,</hi>

<pb n="346" facs="tcp:10095:182"/> that the Arke was adored. And thus our diſputants, becauſe wee kneele before the Sacrament, doe conclude that we kneele to the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament.</p>
                  <p>But indeede, as the foure and twenty Elders falling downe to him that ſate on the Throne, though they fell downe before the Throne, did not worſhip the Throne,<note place="margin">Reu. 4.10.</note> but him that <hi>liues for euer:</hi> So we, when we kneele before the Sacrament, at the receiuing of it, doe not kneele to the Sacrament, but to Chriſt the Authour of the Sacrament,<note place="margin">Rom. 9.5.</note>

                     <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="8"/> The eighth Argument is this: <hi>It was brought in by that Antichrist of Rome,</hi>

                     <hi>for the worſhip of his Breaden god, therefore it cannot lawfully be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained by the true Profeſſors of the Gospell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For anſwere to which, I deny both parts of the Argument. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Antecedent, it hath two branches, and neither ſound:
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:10095:182"/> the one, that Kneeling was brought in by that Antichriſt of Rome; the other, that it was brought in for the worſhip of his Breaden god.</p>
                  <p>Now to the firſt. I demand what Antichriſt that was who brought in Kneeling at the Sacrament?<note place="margin">As the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monition to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament: and others.</note> Some there are, who peremptorily affirme that it was <hi>Honorius</hi> the third. But that is not true: For albeit <hi>Honorius</hi> made a Decree for the adoring of the Sacrament, at the time of Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation; yet wee finde not one ſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable to proue that he decreed any Geſture for the time and act of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipation. Yea,<note place="margin">Diſp. pa. 81.</note> it is confidently affirmed by him who wrote the Diſpute, that Kneeling in the Act of Receiuing, was not brought in by <hi>Honorius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now if you demand, by whom was it then brought in: ſilence, or ignorance muſt be the anſwer. But me thinkes, ſuch a confident aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that both croſſeth the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and troubleth the peace of the Church, ſhould haue ſome direct
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:10095:183"/> and poſitiue proofe, &amp; not depend vpon probability. In ſtead whereof there is this reaſon giuen; We find neither decree nor practice of knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, till after the time of <hi>Honorius:</hi> therefore it is not like, that either he, or any before him brought it in. But if that reaſon be good, then I may co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>clude that it was neither de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed by <hi>Honorius,</hi> nor any other Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of Rome following, becauſe we find no decree thereof vpon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord.</p>
                  <p>It is further affirmed, that ſitting was the geſture in the act of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing in the time of the inſtitution, and diuers yeeres after; and then ſtanding, from about the yeere one hundred and fifty, to the yeere one thouſand two hundred and twentie and vpward.</p>
                  <p>I anſwere, that concerning the geſture vſed by Chriſt in the inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, I haue already ſpoken, and now I will very briefely examine the teſtimonies inferred for proofe of the ages ſucceeding.</p>
                  <pb n="349" facs="tcp:10095:183"/>

                  <p>Now ſaith the Diſpute, If the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple had kneeled in the time of recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing, he would as well haue ſhe wed that, as the other practices in pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and hearing the Word of God. For anſwere whereunto might not I ſay, If the people had ſtood or ſate in the time of receiuing, would he not as well haue ſhewed that, as the other practices in praying and hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Word? But further, I ſay, had that Father eſteemed the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture at the Sacrament a thing ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall, as you account it, doubtleſſe he would haue ſhewed their pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, but becauſe he did not ſo e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteeme it, he did not at all mention it.

                  <p>Thus wee ſee, that what hath bin vrged and alleaged, doth not proue the firſt branch of the Antecedent, namely, That kneeling in the act of receiuing, was brought in by that Antichriſt of Rome, and therefore much leſs can the ſecond be proued, <hi>videlitet,</hi> that it was brought in for worſhip of a Breaden god.

<pb n="355" facs="tcp:10095:186"/> Author, ſo much leſſe concerning that end.</p>
                  <p>Now as the Antecedent is vncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, ſo is the Argument vnſound. Some Antichriſtian Biſhop brought in kneeling in the act of receiuing: or thus, it hath beene abuſed to Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry by ſome Antichriſtan Biſhop, therefore it is vnlawfull. A man might as well reaſon thus:<note place="margin">Macrob. Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur. lib. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>6.</hi>

                     <hi>After the doings of the land of Egypt, and the land of Canaan, you ſhall not doe,</hi> that hath relation to thoſe ſinnes of vncleanneſſe which are mentioned in the ſame Chapter.

After the manner of the Pagans and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſts ſhall you not doe: But the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans &amp; Papiſts doe kneele in prayer: therefore you ſhall kneele in prayer. Or rather thus, the Papiſts and Pagans doe kneele to their Idols, therefore Profeſſors of the Goſpell may not kneele to God. For ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is inferred, becauſe the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts in the act of receiuing doe kneele to the bread, therefore we in the ſame act may not kneele to God.</p>

                  <p>If Antichriſt haue ſtained this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture by his Idolatry, ſhall Chriſtia<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s therefore, hauing purged it, bee debarred of their lawfull intereſt therein? Or rather as the Iſraelite hauing taken in warre a woman a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the enemies, when he had ſhaued her head, &amp; paired her nailes, might take her home as his owne: may not the Church of God take this geſture, being pared and purged from Romiſh corruption, and apply it to the ſeruice of God?</p>

                  <p>Againe, to the poſitions of theſe men they add the fact of <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> who did not ſeeke to purge, but brake in pieces the brazen Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; and the practice of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Chriſt, who held it not ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient by doctrine to ſpeake againſt the Iewiſh waſhings, and ſo to vſe them to another end, but refuſed that cuſtome wholly.</p>
                  <p>Hereunto I anſwer firſt, Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar facts, euen of worthy men, doe not tye vs neceſſarily to imitation. <hi>Moſes</hi> proceeded farre againſt the Iſraelites Idolatry,<note place="margin">Exo. 32.20</note> when <hi>he tooke the golden calfe, burnt it in the fire, and ground it to powder, ſtrew it vpon the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and made them to drinke of it.</hi> What, haue others ſinned that haue not done the like?</p>
                  <pb n="363" facs="tcp:10095:190"/>
                  <p>Againe, there is great difference betweene the brazen ſerpent, and kneeling at the Communion, both in their nature and vſe. In their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the one being a tranſient acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the other a permanent ſubſtance, and conſequently more apt to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſed to Idolatry. In their vſe: for the vertue of cure being vaniſhed, the brazen ſerpent ceaſed to be of vſe. But the act of kneeling will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer remaine neceſſary, to manifeſt our humble thankefulneſſe for ſo great benefits, as we receiue by the bleſſed Sacrament.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There was great cauſe why <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſhould thus proceede a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the brazen ſerpent, in regard that <hi>To thoſe dayes the children of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael burnt incenſe to it.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">2. Reg. 18.4</note> But ſo is not the geſture of kneeling abuſed by vs, and therefore needs not ſuch an abſolute aboliſhing.</p>
                  <p>And for our Sauiours practice, it is rather with vs then againſt vs; for though he did ſhunne the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious waſhings of the Phariſes:
